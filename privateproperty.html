Me, Justin David Movick, hold this trust. God's kid here. Stuff's not really mine. All in for Christ's big deal.

Ten Tribes, Israel â€“ got it covered. New Jerusalem, it's in America, believe that. Christ takes the lead, Earth gets a redo.

Changes for Earth? Yep, we need those. Chief Seattle knew, Earth's sacred.

My things? God's eyes on that. I follow, work hard. Big reign? I'm in, building the way. Ju. D. Movick, that's me, creator's idea.

With all due respect,
Ju. D. Movick
