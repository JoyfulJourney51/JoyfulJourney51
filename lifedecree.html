Decree of Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness

Let it be known that I, Justin David Movick, hereby declare and decree against any form of suicide proper, in my representation and person, Justin Movick.

I affirm the value and sanctity of life, recognizing it as a gift from the divine, and pledge to cherish and honor this precious existence. I firmly believe that life is meant to be lived fully, embracing the experiences it offers and continually seeking growth and transformation.

In the pursuit of liberty, I strive to break free from any mental or emotional shackles that may hinder my progress. I reject the notion of being enslaved by self-doubt, harmful habits, or limiting beliefs. Instead, I seek freedom from the chains that hold me back, aiming to live as a free and empowered individual.

Though the pursuit of happiness may at times seem elusive, I refuse to succumb to despair or hopelessness. I acknowledge that challenges are part of life's journey, and I commit to finding joy in the simple moments, the pursuit of wisdom, and the practice of love and compassion towards others.

I denounce any label or diagnosis that may attempt to define me in ways that contradict my true essence. I embrace my uniqueness and potential, knowing that I am not bound by any external judgment or limitations.

I seek solace in activities that bring me happiness and fulfillment, such as exercise, study, work that aligns with divine order, and games that stimulate my mind. I look forward to a future filled with meaningful connections, love, family, travel, and exploration of different cultures and cuisines.

I recognize that seeking help and support is a sign of strength, not weakness, and I will not hesitate to reach out to others when needed. I surround myself with positive influences and engage in practices that nourish my well-being.

I stand firmly in love and faith, acknowledging Jesus Christ as my Redeemer, Savior, and the source of true hope. With determination and resilience, I shall rise above any challenges that come my way, striving to create a life filled with purpose, happiness, and love.

May this decree serve as a testament to my commitment to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and may it guide me towards a future of fulfillment and abundance.

So be it, this 8th day of August, 2023.

JDM- Justin David Movick
